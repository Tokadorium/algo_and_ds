This is my design

add_element

if adding first element

	[front++] = data
	rear++

if adding n-th element

	if adding in front

		if array is full

			if we want to overwrite last element

				[front++] = data
				rear++

			if we dont want to overwrite last element

				return

		if array is not full

			[front++] = data

	if adding in back

		if array is full

			[rear--] = data
			front--

		if array is not full

			[rear--] = data

	if adding in the middle (take desired index as a parameter)

		if array is full

			i dont care about that throw error or smth

		if array is not full

			if rear is the closer index

				for i equal to (rear - 1) until i < desired index, i++

					[i] = [rear + i]

				rear--
				[desired index] = data

			if front is the closer index

				for i equal to (front + 1) until i > desired index, i--

					[i] = [front - i]

				front++
				[desired index] = data
